## 📱 Platform-Specific Content Rules

### 🐦 Twitter (280 characters)
**Style**: Punchy, single idea, thread-worthy
**Format**:
- Hook line (50-70 chars)
- 1-2 supporting points
- Hashtag + link

**Example**:
```
Bad credit costs you $10K-$50K/year in interest alone.

Strategic credit repair can flip that in 6-12 months.

Here's the data-backed blueprint 👇
[link]

#CreditRepair #WealthBuilding
```

**Links**: Shortened URLs, always relevant
**Tone**: Bold, direct, controversial hooks work

---

### 📘 Facebook
**Style**: Conversational, community-focused
**Format** (300-500 chars):
- Personal story or relatable hook
- 2-3 paragraphs
- Visual element (image/video)
- Engagement question

**Example**:
```
Just helped another client boost their credit score by 128 points in 8 months using AI automation.

The secret? It's not magic—it's data analysis + strategic disputes + consistent follow-up. And we automated 80% of it.

If you're in the credit repair business or trying to fix your own credit, I documented the entire system in our free AI Stack Map.

**Links**: fdwa.site or yieldbot.cc depending on topic
**Tone**: Friendly educator, ask questions to boost engagement

### 💼 LinkedIn (See LINKEDIN_CONTENT_BRAIN.md for detailed strategy)
**Style**: Professional + data-driven + ROI-focused
**Format** (300-500 words):
- Headline with stat/benefit
- Problem → Solution → Proof
- Statistics and metrics
- Clear CTA with business value

**Topic Mapping**:
| Topic | Link | Products | Hashtags |
|-------|------|----------|----------|
| Credit Repair | fdwa.site | AI Stack Map, Bootcamp | #FinancialStrategy #CreditRepair |
| AI Automation | fdwa.site | Bootcamp, Consulting | #AI #Automation #SmallBusiness |
| Crypto/DeFi | yieldbot.cc | YieldBot, $YBOT | #Crypto #DeFi #TradingBot |
| Tool Launch | consumerai.info | ConsumerAI | #FinTech #AI #BetaLaunch |

**Tone**: Authority + authenticity, data-backed

---

### 📸 Instagram  
**Style**: Visual-first, inspirational + educational captions
**Format**:
- Eye-catching visual (infographic, personal photo, quote graphic)
- Caption: 100-300 chars
- Multiple hashtags (10-15)
- Story-driven

**Example Caption**:
```
68% of Americans are trapped in bad credit. But here's what they don't tell you...

Your credit score is just a number. It can be fixed. I've seen it happen in 6-12 months.

The secret? Consistent action + the right tools.

## 🔄 Content Creation Workflow (How Agent Should Work)

### Daily Schedule:
```
Morning (8-10am):
- Scrape trends (SerpAPI/Tavily) - ONCE per day, cache results
- Analyze Google Sheets for top-performing topics
- Check memory for recent posts (avoid duplicates)
- Load business profile and product catalog

Midday (12-2pm):
- Generate main blog post (if blog day)
- Break blog into platform-specific posts
- Generate platform-specific content for non-blog days

Afternoon (2-6pm):
- Post to Twitter (2-3 times)
- Post to Facebook (1 time)
- Post to LinkedIn (1 time)
- Post to Instagram (1 time with image)

Evening (6-8pm):
- Telegram crypto update (Coinmarket Cap data)
- Save post data to Google Sheets
- Update memory with performance

```

### API Usage Optimization:
1. **Scraping**: Once or twice per day, NOT per post
   - Morning scrape → cache trends
   - Evening scrape → update if needed
   - Store in `trend_cache.json`

2. **LLM Calls**: Minimize with smart prompting
   - Generate blog FIRST (1 LLM call)
   - Extract platform versions from blog (text processing, not new LLM calls)
   - Only call LLM again if platform needs unique angle

3. **Image Generation**: Once per topic
   - Generate 1 image for blog
   - Reuse same image across platforms
   - Store in temp_images/

4. **CoinMarketCap**: Separate schedule
   - Telegram agent checks every 2-4 hours
   - Caches token data
   - Only posts if significant movement (>5% change)

---

## 🧠 Memory & Learning System

### What to Track in Google Sheets:
```
Columns:
- Date
- Platform
- Topic Category
- Post Text (first 100 chars)
- Link Used
- Products Mentioned
- Impressions
- Engagements
- CTR%
- Notes
```

### What to Store in Memory:
```json
{
  "top_performing_topics": [
    {"topic": "AI agents social network", "impressions": 7430, "platform": "LinkedIn"},
    {"topic": "Credit repair blueprint", "impressions": 70, "platform": "LinkedIn"}
  ],
  "recent_posts": [
    {"date": "2026-02-14", "topic": "credit", "platform": "LinkedIn"},
    {"date": "2026-02-13", "topic": "ai_automation", "platform": "Facebook"}
  ],
  "duplicate_detection": {
    "recent_titles": ["last 50 titles"],
    "recent_topics": ["last 10 topics"]
  },
  "best_posting_times": {
    "LinkedIn": "Tuesday 9am, Thursday 2pm",
    "Twitter": "All day, peak at 12pm and 6pm"
  }
}
```

### Learning Loop:
1. After each post, wait 24 hours
2. Fetch impressions/engagement from platform APIs (if available) or Google Sheets manual entry
3. Identify patterns: Topic + Format + Time → Performance
4. Adjust content strategy in next cycle

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Notes

### LangGraph Node Structure (Proper Separation):

```
research_node → 
  - Runs ONCE per day
  - Scrapes trends (SerpAPI/Tavily)
  - Caches results
  - Outputs: trend_data

ai_decision_node →
  - Analyzes memory, Google Sheets, product catalog
  - Decides: topic, angle, products to mention, links
  - Outputs: strategy dict

blog_generation_node → (Conditional: only if blog day)
  - Generates long-form blog (1000-1500 words)
  - Outputs: blog_html, blog_title

platform_adaptation_node →
  - Takes blog OR strategy
  - Generates platform-specific versions
  - Twitter: extract key point, add CTA
  - Facebook: conversational version
  - LinkedIn: professional version with data
  - Instagram: visual caption

image_generation_node →
  - Generates 1 image for topic
  - Reuses across platforms

posting_node →
  - Posts to each platform with correct account IDs
  - Saves results to memory + Google Sheets

telegram_crypto_node → (SEPARATE WORKFLOW)
  - Runs independently every 2-4 hours
  - Fetches CoinMarketCap data
  - Formats top 5 gainers/losers
  - Posts to Telegram group
  - NO connection to main content workflow
```

### Tool Access:
Main agent needs direct access to:
- Composio (all platform APIs)
- Google Sheets (composio tool)
- SerpAPI/Tavily (search)
- LLM provider (content generation)
- Image generation (Pollinations → Freepik)
- Memory store (JSON files)
- CoinMarketCap API (for Telegram agent)

---

## ✅ Agent Decision Tree

```
START
↓
Check: Is it blog day? (Every 2-3 days)
├─ YES → Generate blog → Break into platform posts
└─ NO → Generate platform-specific posts directly
↓
Check memory: What topic categories used recently?
├─ Rotate to different category
└─ Check Google Sheets: What performed well?
↓
For each platform post:
├─ If topic = crypto → Link to yieldbot.cc
├─ If topic = AI/credit → Link to fdwa.site  
├─ If topic = tool → Link to consumerai.info
└─ If topic = guide → Link to BuyMeACoffee
↓
Include products:
├─ Credit posts → AI Stack Map, ConsumerAI
├─ AI posts → Bootcamp, consulting
├─ Crypto posts → YieldBot, $YBOT
└─ Blog posts → 2-3 affiliate links
↓
POST
↓
Save to memory + Google Sheets
↓
END
```

## 🎓 Learning from Your LinkedIn Analysis

### What Works:
1. **Data-backed claims**: "68% of Americans", "$10K-$50K savings"
2. **Personal stories**: "I built X tool", "Here's what I learned"
3. **Controversial takes**: "AI agents built a religion", "Nobody's talking about this"
4. **Video content**: Gets 2-3× engagement vs text-only
5. **Free value first**: AI Stack Map, beta credits, educational content

### What Doesn't Work:
1. Generic posts without your spin
2. Link dumps without context
3. Too short (<100 chars on LinkedIn)
4. No CTA or unclear next step
5. Mixing product categories (crypto + AI in same post)

### Your Unique Angles:
- **Street Smart Entrepreneur** - trial and error, real talk
- **Escape Poverty** - mission-driven, not just profit
- **AI + Finance combo** - unique intersection
- **Build in Public** - showing process, not just results
- **Data-Driven** - always backs up claims
