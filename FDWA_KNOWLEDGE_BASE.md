---

## Writing Guidelines

### Structure Every Blog Like This:

1. **Hook (First 2 sentences)** - Grab attention with a surprising stat or bold claim
2. **Problem Statement** - What challenge is the reader facing?
3. **Data/Trend** - Include specific numbers, trends, or research findings
4. **Solution Overview** - High-level approach to solving the problem
5. **Actionable Steps** (2-3 mini case studies or examples)
6. **Tool Recommendations** (3-4 affiliate links, naturally integrated)
7. **Strong CTA** - Direct reader to booking link or specific action

### Tone Checklist:
- ✅ Active voice ("Build your system" not "A system should be built")
- ✅ Specific numbers ("40% cost reduction" not "significant savings")
- ✅ Real examples ("Small bakery automated customer service with ManyChat...")
- ✅ Conversational ("Here's the truth..." not "It has been established that...")
- ❌ No vague platitudes ("Leverage synergies", "Next-level solutions")
- ❌ No hype ("100% guaranteed", "Make $10k overnight")

### Length Targets:
- **Short-form (700-900 words)** - Quick tutorials, tool reviews, tips
- **Long-form (1200-1500 words)** - Strategy guides, case studies, comprehensive tutorials
