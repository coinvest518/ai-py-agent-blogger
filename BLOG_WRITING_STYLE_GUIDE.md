# FDWA Blog Writing Style Guide
## Creating Full, Detailed, Educational Content That Converts

This guide teaches the AI how to write blogs that match FDWA's proven style - educational, detailed, and conversion-focused.

---

## Core Philosophy

**NOT THIS:** Bland, generic blog posts that say "here's a tool, click here"

**BUT THIS:** Full educational articles that:
- Break down complex topics into actionable steps
- Explain WHY tools/strategies matter with real data
- Show HOW to apply information to your business
- Include real examples with specific numbers ($1,000 → $24,000)
- Naturally embed affiliate links with clear benefits
- Guide readers through practical implementation

---

## Content Structure

### 1. Opening Hook (100-200 words)
- **Start with impact:** Real data, statistics, or compelling statement
- **Example:** "Weather trading bots are exploding in popularity on X, generating thousands of dollars in monthly profits"
- **Include proof:** Specific numbers, real profiles, concrete examples
- **Set expectations:** Tell readers what they'll learn and achieve

### 2. Context & Data (150-300 words)
- **Current events:** Latest trends, growth rates, market data
- **Statistics:** "84% of organizations already rely on low- or no-code tools"
- **Industry insights:** What's changing, why it matters now
- **Real examples:** "One trader grew $1,000 to $24,000 since April 2025"

### 3. Main Educational Content (800-1500 words)

#### For Tool Guides:
- **Organized by category:** Not just a list, but grouped logically
- **Each tool gets:**
  - What it does (1 sentence, benefit-focused)
  - Why you need it (specific use case)
  - Special offer/benefit (free credits, discount percentage)
  - Affiliate link embedded naturally

**Example:**
```markdown
## Business Banking, Payments & Finance
Get paid, move money, and scale legally.

**Airwallex** – Global business banking, cards, and payouts:
https://partners.airwallex.com/1m79w4jv1hza-szu9ji

**Bolt Business** – Control, monitor, and manage business travel worldwide using one central platform.
https://get.business.bolt.eu/lx55rhexokw9
```

#### For Tutorial/How-To Guides:
- **Step-by-step breakdown:** Numbered steps, clear progression
- **Real commands/code:** Actual examples readers can copy
- **Why each step matters:** Don't just say "do this," explain the purpose
- **Troubleshooting:** "If you encounter issues, check..."
- **Optimization tips:** How to improve, scale, or customize

### 4. The Reality Check (100-200 words)
- **Be honest:** "I read the property claim manuals and guides — it's a maze"
- **Address pain points:** What people struggle with, why it's hard
- **Position your solution:** How your approach cuts through the BS
- **Build trust:** Show you understand their challenges

### 5. Resources & Links Section
- **FDWA products:** Relevant to topic (AI consultation, credit repair, courses)
- **Community links:** Whop, newsletter, social media, LinkTree
- **Affiliate tools:** Organized by category with brief descriptions
- **Consultation booking:** Cal.com links for appropriate service type

### 6. Disclaimers (when applicable)
- **Trading/investing:** "Trading involves risk of loss..."
- **Credit/legal:** "We provide guidance, not legal advice..."
- **Results:** "Results vary; past performance not indicative of future results"

## Writing Tone & Voice

### ✅ DO:
- **Conversational but authoritative:** "We're back with more valuable information"
- **Direct and honest:** "The reason this matters is..."
- **Educational:** Teach, don't just pitch
- **Data-driven:** Back claims with numbers
- **Action-oriented:** Tell readers exactly what to do
- **Personal:** "I run up a serious bill with AI tools like Cursor and Claude AI"

### ❌ DON'T:
- **Generic fluff:** "In today's digital age..."
- **Weak CTAs:** "Click here to learn more"
- **Just list tools:** Must explain WHY and HOW
- **Be overly salesy:** Education first, conversion follows
- **Skip the details:** Give full, actionable information

---

## Affiliate Link Integration

### ❌ WRONG:
"Check out ElevenLabs for AI voice"

### ✅ RIGHT:
"Need AI voice that sounds human? **ElevenLabs** offers ultra-realistic narration and audio content (get 50% off first 3 months):
https://try.elevenlabs.io/2dh4kqbqw25i"

### Integration Patterns:

1. **Need-Benefit-Link:**
   - "Need [problem]? [Tool] offers [solution with benefit] ([discount/offer]): [link]"

2. **Category-organized:**
   - Group by function: "AI Automation & No-Code Builders", "Business Banking", etc.
   - Brief category description
   - Tools with individual descriptions

3. **Contextual mentions:**
   - Embed naturally in tutorial steps
   - Reference when explaining concepts
   - Include in "Tools We Use" sections

---

## Content Length Guidelines

- **Minimum:** 700 words (brief guide)
- **Standard:** 1000-1500 words (full article)
- **Tutorial:** 1500-2500 words (step-by-step guide)

**Quality over quantity:** Every word should add value, but don't skimp on detail.
